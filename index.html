        <h2>So, last couple of nights, I've been watching a lot of movies. From actions that feel exhilaratingly brutal to the most serene and mind-inducing imagery of them. Even though the genres seem to be contradictory to each other, they happen to have one common correlation with one another: all of them came from a certain country of Japan. Japanese media, especially in the realm of movies, has been on my side of fond memories since I was a little kid till now as my appreciation of media that are outside of my language is something that can give us a perspective of what are they trying to say while also expressing themselves in an artistic way possible. And for that reason alone, I'll give a short review of the three movies that Iâ€™ve watched and try to figure out what is core message of them all. </h2>
